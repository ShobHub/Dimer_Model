# Dimer_Model

This repository contains code related to the classical dimer model on random and aperiodic graphs.

## Contents

1. **E_WormAlgo_dimer.py**  
   Energy-based worm algorithm to generate ground state samples for the dimer model on various graphs. Also computes physical observables such as specific heat, energy cumulants, and other parameters.

2. **FKT_MMC.py**  
   Calculates exact monomer–monomer correlation functions using the Fisher–Kasteleyn–Temperley (FKT) approach.

3. **Heights.py**  
   Computes height configurations for each plaquette on arbitrary graphs.

4. **ModifiedTiling.py**  
   Generates modified trivalent Penrose tilings of any given size.

5. **RandomG_New.py**  
   Constructs height gem graphs of arbitrary size using random walks.
